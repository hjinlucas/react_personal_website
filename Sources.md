# Here are the sources/tools I use in this project

# 1. Websites that provide pre-defined color palettes and CSS variable sets that can be used for projects:

a. [Color Hunt](https://colorhunt.co)

b. [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co)

# 2. Google Fonts:

For changing the website fonts with the one I like.

# 3. How I deploy my website

a. For now, I am using github to host the website

b. Here is how to do it:

(1). Create a new repository, name the repository as yourusername.github.io (replace yourusername with your GitHub username).

(2). Upload content: Upload e-portfolio files to the newly created repository.

(3). Enable GitHub Pages: In the repository, go to the "Settings" tab, scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section, and select the "main" branch as the source. Save changes.

(4).Visit e-portfolio: After enabling GitHub Pages, the e-portfolio will be available at https://yourusername.github.io. It may take a few minutes for the site to become available after enabling GitHub Pages.

Reminder: There are other platforms like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com), [Vercel](https://vercel.com), or [GitLabPages](https://about.gitlab.com/stages-devops-lifecycle/pages/) that also offer free hosting for static websites.
